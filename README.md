# CSS Flexbox Layout Module
Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:

* Block, for sections in a webpage
* Inline, for text
* Table, for two-dimensional table data
* Positioned, for explicit position of an element

The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.
